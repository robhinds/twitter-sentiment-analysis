# Spring-reactor-twitter  

Wanted to play around with reactor framework so started with this project/framework.  At the moment just a webapp that lets users connect to Twitter OAuth and then connects to the streaming sample API (1% of the twitter firehose according to the docs).

At the moment the event consumer is just logging the tweet data. Will play around with adding some more consumers.
